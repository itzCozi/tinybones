# MDX in tinybones

This blog supports MDX (Markdown with JSX), allowing you to use React-like components directly in your markdown content. MDX combines the simplicity of markdown with the power of components.

## Using InfoBox Component

The blog comes with a built-in InfoBox component that you can use to display admonitions. Here's how to use it:

<InfoBox>
  This is a default information box that you can use to highlight important
  information.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning">
  This is a warning box to alert users about potential issues.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="danger">
  This is an error box to indicate something that went wrong.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="note">
  This is a note box for additional context or asides.
</InfoBox>

## Custom Titles and Icons

You can customize both the title and icon of the InfoBox:

<InfoBox title="Custom Title" icon={CircleHelp}>
  This InfoBox has a custom title instead of the default "Information" and a
  custom icon.
</InfoBox>

## The Code

To use the InfoBox component in your MDX file, first import it at the top of your file:

```

title: Your Blog Post Title
description: Your description here
publicationDate: 2025-08-21
---

import InfoBox from "@/components/mdx/InfoBox.astro";
import { CircleHelp } from "lucide-astro";

# Your content here

<InfoBox type="info">Your important information here.</InfoBox>
```

## Available InfoBox Types

The InfoBox component supports the following types:

- `info` (default)
- `warning`
- `danger`
- `note`

But of course you can add your own with ease.

## Creating Your Own Components

You can create your own components and use them in MDX. Just create a new `.astro` file in the `src/components/mdx/` directory, and then import and use it in your MDX files.

<InfoBox type="note" title="Developer Note">
  MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to combine the simplicity of Markdown
  with the expressiveness of JSX. This makes your content more interactive and
  engaging for readers.
</InfoBox>

## Dynamic Content

One of the benefits of using MDX is that you can include dynamic content. For example:

{(function() {
const currentDate = new Date();
return <p>This page was rendered on {currentDate.toLocaleDateString()}.</p>;
})()}
