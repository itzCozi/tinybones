# Building a Series: Part 1

This post kicks off a small two–part series demonstrating the new **post series** feature just added to this blog. Series let you group related posts and navigate them in order.

In this first part we cover motivation and schema changes:

1. Added optional `series` slug and numeric `seriesIndex` to blog frontmatter.
2. Created `/series` index and `/series/[series]` dynamic listing pages.
3. Enhanced individual posts with intra–series navigation and a list of all parts.

In Part 2 we will look at best practices for structuring longer series and retrofitting older content.

Continue with Part 2 once it's published!
